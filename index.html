<h1>Plant Height Scatter Plots</h1>
<p>During this assignment we recieved a csv file that contained various different heights of different plants. 
  We had to compare the height data to the temperature.</p><p> I created a scatter plot to display
  this information for Height/Temperature, Height/Rain, Height/Altitude, and Height/Site Number. 
  Scatter plots are very useful to visualize all of the data and get an idea of the slope of the graph.</p>
